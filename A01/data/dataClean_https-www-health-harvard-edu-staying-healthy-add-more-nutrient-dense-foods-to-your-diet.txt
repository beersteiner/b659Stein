Add more nutrient-dense foods to your diet

Updated: July 17, 2015Published: July, 2015

Foods such as kale, cantaloupe, and quinoa can boost the amount of nutrients you consume without increasing calories.

Getting enough nutrients through diet is challenging as we age.
Our bodies don't absorb nutrients as well as they once did, yet we tend to need fewer calories and eat less.
So it's important to make the most out of the foods we do eat.
One way is by choosing more nutrient-dense foods, which provide more nutrition bang for the calorie buck.
"They contain an abundance of nutrients and other healthful substances—vitamins and minerals, fiber, lean protein, and unsaturated fats—but are not excessive in calories.
This is compared with foods of low nutrient density that are high in calories," says Liz Moore, a registered dietitian at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.

Don't sit so much

Sitting for long stretches of time increases the odds of illness and untimely death.
Here are some simple tricks to get yourself out of your chair: While you're on the phone, stand up and walk around.
When watching TV, stand and pace during commercials.
Instead of sitting at your makeup table, stand up.
In general, try to get on your feet every 30 minutes.
