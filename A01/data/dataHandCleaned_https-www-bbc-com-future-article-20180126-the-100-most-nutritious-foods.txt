After analysing more than 1,000 raw foods, researchers ranked the ingredients that provide the best balance of your daily nutritional requirements – and they found a few surprises.

Imagine the ideal food.
One that contains all the nutrients necessary to meet, but not exceed, our daily nutrient demands.
If such a food existed, consuming it, without eating any other, would provide the optimal nutritional balance for our body.

Such a food does not exist.
But we can do the next best thing.

The key is to eat a balance of highly nutritional foods, that when consumed together, do not contain too much of any one nutrient, to avoid exceeding daily recommended amounts.

Scientists studied more than 1,000 foods, assigning each a nutritional score.
The higher the score, the more likely each food would meet, but not exceed your daily nutritional needs, when eaten in combination with others.

Calculated and ranked by scientists, these are the 100 most nutritious foods:

Please note: a few of the foods listed are endangered species, which we would not recommend.
We would advise researching the provenance of all ingredients if buying them yourself.
