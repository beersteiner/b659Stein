dairy products are a healthy source of various important nutrients.

Full-fat dairy seems to be the best, and studies show that people who eat the most full-fat dairy have a lower risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes (

13,

14).

If the dairy comes from grass-fed cows, it may be even more nutritious — as it’s higher in some bioactive fatty acids like

conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and vitamin K2.

single slice may offer about the same amount of nutrients as an entire cup (240 ml) of milk.
