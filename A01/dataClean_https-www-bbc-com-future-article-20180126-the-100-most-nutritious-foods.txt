John Bunker, an apple collector based in Palermo, Maine, has rescued numerous forgotten breeds from extinction.
These include apples that used to be grown a century or more ago before orcharding became so Delicious-focused, including the magnificent Black Oxford, an apple whose red is so dark you might mistake it for an enormous plum before seeing its brilliant white flesh.

Several years ago a freshly deciphered Egyptian papyrus revealed that even 1,900 years ago, cures for the after-effects of consuming too much alcohol were on people&rsquo;s minds &ndash; the recommended option in this case being a necklace made out of the leatherleaf plant.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVarious other treatments suggested by folklore include a breakfast of pickled herrings, a fried canary (thanks, Romans), salty plums, and the Prairie Oyster, an American concoction consisting of raw eggs, tomato juice, hot sauce, and other fixings.

Ethanol is degraded by liver enzymes into acetaldehyde, and then further broken down into acetate, which turns into fatty acids and water.
Some scientists have speculated that acetaldehyde may cause some hangover symptoms, especially given evidence that drunkenness occurs more quickly in people with mutations that hamper the enzymes that remove it.
But some studies suggest that acetaldehyde levels don&rsquo;t correlate with hangover severity.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},"cardType":"Body","iFrameType":"","id":"future\u002Farticle\u002F20181224-no-you-cant-eat-your-way-out-of-a-hangover-0"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[]},"cardType":"Image","iFrameType":"","image":["p06wh3rg"],"imageAlignment":"centre","id":"future\u002Farticle\u002F20181224-no-you-cant-eat-your-way-out-of-a-hangover-1"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[],"html":"\u003Cp\u003EOthers are suspicious not merely of the alcohol itself or its metabolites, but what comes along with them&mdash;the substances in drinks that give them their colour and flavour, sometimes called congeners.

Drinking alcohol does result in a shift in hormone regulation that can cause people to urinate more, so they may be dehydrated the next day, helping to account for the headache.
People often drink at the expense of getting a full night of sleep, and alcohol impairs the quality of the sleep they do get once they bed down.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fatigue and confusion may come in part from too little sleep or poor sleep.
Some researchers have floated the idea that the fuzzy-headedness and cognitive impairment of the hangover may stem from immune activation of some kind, citing higher levels of certain inflammatory compounds.
&ldquo;There are theories of the alcohol hangover being an immune response to heavy alcohol intake,&rdquo; says Joris C Verster, a professor at Utrecht University who studies the physiology of hangovers.
&ldquo;Research is currently in progress to examine immune messenger substances such as cytokines.&rdquo;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe internet abounds with well-meant suggestions about what to eat to help dull the pain.
Bananas are sometimes bandied about as hangover helpers, with some suggesting that they can replenish nutrients like potassium lost while drinking.
But nutrient deficiency is not likely to be a cause of hangover symptoms, nor are you likely to have such a deficiency after a single night of drinking.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},"cardType":"Body","iFrameType":"","id":"future\u002Farticle\u002F20181224-no-you-cant-eat-your-way-out-of-a-hangover-4"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[]},"cardType":"Image","iFrameType":"","image":["p06wh43g"],"imageAlignment":"centre","id":"future\u002Farticle\u002F20181224-no-you-cant-eat-your-way-out-of-a-hangover-5"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[],"html":"\u003Cp\u003EHeavy, greasy food &ndash; a classic &lsquo;Full English&rsquo; or diner breakfast &ndash; is sometimes talked about as something that can help.
But this seems to be a confused version of the advice to eat heavily before drinking, so that alcohol absorption is slowed; there is no evidence that it helps afterwards.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome suggest eating eggs, with the justification that they contain an amino acid used in the breakdown of acetaldehyde.
This, too, is a bit fanciful as a hangover aid.
There is no good evidence that consuming that amino acid (which, incidentally, is contained in other foods as well) helps with symptoms either.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETreating the symptoms with rest, water, and aspirin is likely to be the best treatment for some time to come.
Eating a hearty meal beforehand and drinking slowly can help keep the levels of alcohol and other substances your liver and the rest of your body have to deal with at a manageable level throughout the night.
But the best way to avoid a hangover is to not drink to excess.
If you need something to motivate you, imagine eating a fried canary while reeling from nausea.
The only thing worse than the hangover may be the cure.

Water might encourage bacterial life, but in this case it also allows the cure, as the salt and nitrite mixture is known, to trickle further.

While that particular bill did not pass Parliament, another one did, mandating that markets should stay open on Christmas and legislating that nothing in church services should be out of the ordinary that day.

She then adds, &ldquo;If you chuse[sic] meat in your pies parboil a neat&rsquo;s tongue, peel it, and chop the meat as fine as possible and mix with the rest.&rdquo; While the recipe is a bit ambiguous &ndash; in context it's possible to read it as expecting meat to be layered in with the sweet mince &ndash; this does suggest the option of just a sweet tart, no meat required.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},"cardType":"Body","iFrameType":"","id":"future\u002Farticle\u002F20171208-the-strange-and-twisted-history-of-mince-pies-8"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[]},"cardType":"Image","iFrameType":"","image":["p05qcbsq"],"imageAlignment":"centre","id":"future\u002Farticle\u002F20171208-the-strange-and-twisted-history-of-mince-pies-9"},{"bodyHtml":{"assets":[],"html":"\u003Cp\u003EAs sugar became cheaper and easier to get, thanks to the rise of sugarcane plantations in the West Indies, sweet pies seem to have grown more common.
